Description: Tools for transport planning with an emphasis on spatial transport
    data and non-motorized modes. Enables common transport planning tasks including:
    downloading and cleaning transport datasets; creating geographic "desire lines"
    from origin-destination (OD) data; route assignment, locally and via
    interfaces to routing services such as <http://cyclestreets.net/>;
    calculation of route segment attributes such as bearing and aggregate flow;
    and 'travel watershed' analysis.
